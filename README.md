## The fractal structure of treelines in high mountains

### Project decription
The occurrence of tree species in high mountains usually ends abruptly at some elevation. This is the treeline. Magnifying this region, we find a characteristic ‘mainland/island’ structure, in which the tree cover is continuous at lower elevations (‘mainland’), and gets fragmented at higher ones (‘islands’). Theoretical considerations from percolation theory suggest that the hull of the ‘mainland’ should be a fractal with dimension 7/4. The task is to test this hypothesis using satellite images of treelines. The main goal is to suggest a feasible method for characterising the fractal structure of treelines, taking into account the limitations of real-life ecological data. The method’s potential applications include the precise delineation of species borders, and thus the detection of population shifts due to climate change.
